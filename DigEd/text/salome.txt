SALOME
SCENE- A great terrace in the Palace of Herod, set above the banqueting-hall. Some soldiers are leaning over the balcony. To the right there is a gigantic staircase, to the left, at the back, an old cistern surrounded by a wall of green bronze. The moon is shining very brightly.
THE YOUNG SYRIAN
How beautiful is the Princess Salome to-night!
THE PAGE OF HERODIAS
Look at the moon. How strange the moon seems! She is like a woman rising from a tomb. She is like a dead woman. One might fancy she was looking for dead things.
THE YOUNG SYRIAN
She has a strange look. She is like a little princess who wears a yellow veil, and whose feet are of silver. She is like a princess who has little white doves for feet. One might fancy she was dancing.

FIRST SOLDIER
Why do they dispute about their religion?
SECOND SOLDIER
I cannot tell. They are always doing it. Pharisees, for instance, say that there an and the Sadducees declare that angels do not exist.
FIRST SOLDIER
I think it is ridiculous to dispute about such things.

FIRST SOLDIER
Yes; that is Herodias, the Tetrarch's wife
SECOND SOLDIER
The Tetrarch is very fond of wine wine of three sorts. One which is နိဂံuဉ္စနှီးဂျီးနီ the Island of Samothrace, and is purple 醬

And the third is a wine of Sicily. That wine is as red as blood.
THE NUBIAN
The gods of my country are very fond of blood. \ p^YVM Twice in the year we sacrifice to them young men and maidens: fifty young men and a hundred
maidens. But I am afraid that we never give them quite enough, for they are very harsh to us.
THE CAPPADOCIAN
In my country there are no gods left. The Romans have driven them out. There are some who say that they have hidden themselves in the mountains, but I do not believe it. Three nights I have been on the mountains seeking them every- 0(i 3 where. I did not find them, and at last I called Oکارلا ለሥብ” *イ them by their names, and they did not come. I
think they are dead. rبہمن ہوگا ج FIRST SOLDIER
The Jews worship a God that one cannot see.

FIRST SOLDIER
From the desert, where he fed on locusts and
wild honey. He was clothed in camel's hair, and round his loins he had a leathern belt. He was very terrible to look upon.
A great multitude used to follow him. He even had disciples.
